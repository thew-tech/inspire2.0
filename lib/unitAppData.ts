🔍 Step 2: Cleanability & Sanitation
• Interior: Must be free of grime, mold, pest droppings, or biohazards.
• Odor check: Foul smells may indicate hidden moisture or pest activity.
🧪 Step 3: Functional Testing
• Open/Close All Doors and Drawers: Confirm smooth operation and alignment
• Check Shelving Stability: Apply light pressure to test for sagging or detachment
• Inspect for Moisture or Infestation: Especially under sinks and near laundry plumbing
• Pantry Useability: Ensure shelves are clean, secure, and accessible
📏 Step 4: Accessibility & Local Requirements
• Reach range: Shelves and handles should be within accessibility-compliant height (typically 15–48" AFF)
• Clearance: Doors and drawers must not obstruct egress or accessible paths
• IBU Overlay: May require rounded edges, soft-close hardware, or tactile indicators in elderly housing

• Smoke Test: Only performed by certified professionals—NSPIRE does not require this
📏 Step 4: Accessibility & Local Requirements
• Inspection access: Must be visual—no disassembly or rooftop access required
• Labeling: Chimney systems should be clearly marked if serving multiple units
• IBU Overlay: May require signage, emergency shutoff access, or integration with fire suppression systems
⚒️ Step 5: IRC Structural & Fire Safety Checks
• IRC R1001–R1005: Chimney must be constructed of approved masonry or metal
• Flue must be continuous and properly sized
• Clearance from combustibles must meet code (typically 2 inches)
• Hearth extension must be noncombustible and appropriately sized
• IBU overlays – Local fire safety, seismic, and ventilation codes`
